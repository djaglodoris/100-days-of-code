# 100 Days of CSS and React/Next.js Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of CSS and React/Next.js challenge! I'm excited to be embarking on this journey to strengthen my skills in advanced CSS and React/Next.js development. Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding every day and tracking my progress in this repository.

## Challenge Progress

Here's where I'll be keeping track of my progress throughout the 100 days of code challenge. Each day, I'll update this table with the corresponding day number, the project title, a brief description, and a link to the demo.

| Day | Project Title | Description | Demo |
| --- | ------------ | ----------- | ---- |
| 1 | Loading spinner | Make a beautiful loading spinner with hue-rotate | [Demo Link](https://djaglodoris.github.io/100-days-of-code/challenge/day-1/) |



I can't wait to see how much progress I make over the next 100 days!
